        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            In the shadows where darkness reigns and silence echoes, you'll find me - Yashika. A soul tangled in the threads of despair, finding solace in the depths of the unknown. I am drawn to the mysteries of the universe, where physics meets the void, chemistry dances with chaos, and mathematics unveils the patterns of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            My existence is a journey through the darkest corners of the mind, seeking beauty in the macabre and wisdom in the enigma. I embrace the complexities of life with a somber gaze and a heart that beats to the rhythm of melancholy.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="poetry">
        <h2>Poetry</h2>
        <p>
            Beneath the veil of night, I weave words that bleed emotion. Each poem a testament to the shadows within, a symphony of sorrow and longing. Here, in the silence of the abyss, my voice finds resonance.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Whispers of the Cosmos*<br>
            In the cosmos' void, stars weep their light,<br>
            Galaxies dance in the eternal night.<br>
            Physics whispers secrets untold,<br>
            Of mysteries vast and wonders unfold.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Chemical Lament*<br>
            In the crucible's fire, elements align,<br>
            Bonds forged in chaos, destinies entwine.<br>
            Chemistry's dance, a symphony of change,<br>
            In the alchemy of life, we rearrange.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Mathematical Elegy*<br>
            In numbers' embrace, patterns emerge,<br>
            Geometry's grace, where angles converge.<br>
            Mathematics' language, pure and profound,<br>
            In equations of existence, truths abound.
        </p>

    <section id="music">
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            Music is the pulse of my existence, a melody of melancholy and introspection. Each note resonates with the depths of my soul, echoing the mysteries of the cosmos and the complexities of human emotion.
        </p>

        <h2>Dark Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            Within the labyrinth of my mind, shadows intertwine with thoughts that echo through the corridors of existence. Here lies a contemplation of life's uncertainties and the solitude that embraces the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
            *The Fragile Illusion*<br>
            Life is a delicate dance upon the edge of chaos, where illusions of certainty dissolve into the abyss of the unknown. We grasp for meaning in fleeting moments, only to find solace in the transient beauty of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Echoes of Melancholy*<br>
            In the symphony of silence, echoes of melancholy resonate. Emotions carve their path through the void, weaving tales of longing and loss. We are but fragments of emotion, seeking refuge in the depths of our own solitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            *A Glimpse into Darkness*<br>
            Darkness whispers its secrets, a veil drawn over the complexities of existence. In its embrace, we confront the duality of our nature, embracing shadows that linger beyond the reach of light.
        </p>
        <p>
            *The Uncertainty Principle*<br>
            Certainty fades like smoke in the wind, replaced by the uncertainty that defines our journey. We navigate the paradoxes of existence, knowing that every truth holds a shadow of doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
            *The Enigma of Time*<br>
            Time is a relentless force, an inexorable march towards oblivion. It devours memories, erases existence, leaving only echoes in its wake. We are but fleeting shadows, caught in the eternal dance of seconds and centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Entropy's Embrace*<br>
            Entropy whispers of decay, of gradual dissolution into chaos. Systems unravel, order gives way to disorder, and the universe marches towards eventual heat death. In entropy's embrace, we find the fragility of existence and the inevitability of decay.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Echoes of Existentialism*<br>
            In the silence of solitude, existential questions echo endlessly. What is the purpose of our fleeting existence? Are we mere cosmic accidents, adrift in an indifferent universe? Or do we hold the key to our own meaning, amidst the vastness of cosmic indifference?
